# hello-world
just another repository
I am currently studying how to code and am enjoying the process!
I am originally from El Paso, Texas, but am now residing in Hillsboro, Oregon.
I am interested in sports and music. 
I originally pursued a career in sports broadcast, but am choosing to switch to a career as a software engineer, as the work-life balance did not suit my needs in the sports industry.
